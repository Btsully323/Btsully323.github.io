So, you’re on my website wanting to know about me and the website huh? Odd, but here we go. My name is Billy. I am a junior in high school with a passion for anything with an LCD screen and a lens. I enjoy documenting the fun times that I get to be a part of and the interesting things that I see.
 
Throughout my life, I always thought of myself as creative – I mean, I had a whole animated television show inside my head that I wanted to produce. As time passed, I found myself less and less interested in creating it. I could never seem to really focus on one thing that I wanted to do with my life. I could never really find anything to stay interested in. That changed in late 2022 when I was given a life changing opportunity; I started working for my cities’ public educational programming. I started filming multiple sports games and events, and guess what? I loved it. I finally found my interest – my purpose. Fast forward to January of 2024, I went through a tough time in my life that I think changed me as a person; I realized that I wasn’t allowing myself to experience life how I wanted. So, I began to take this stuff a whole lot more seriously. For example, I made this website!
 
So basically, what I’m saying is that this is me. This website is the representation of what I like to do. Thank you for reading this! Time for frequently asked questions!
