Hey, My name is Billy and im a 17 year old photographer and videographer -- Basically, i like cameras. Welcome to my website! The purpose of this website is to allow people to have the ability to check out my work. If you enjoy my work and would like to hire me for any photo/video related services, feel free to reach out using the links that I have posted in the "Contact" tab. Never been much for writing, so I think this sums up my introduction. Have a great day!
